I graduated from IISER Pune, and am currently an MTech student in Artificial Intelligence at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bengaluru. I have previously worked a bit on Computer Vision via Object Detection models and also on Natural Language Processing via implementing a Semantic Search System for a Thesis. I look forward to learning more about various areas in ML/AI and find my interests.</p> <p>I am open to a 3 month internship during May-July 2025, which would be the break time in studies in my program. Feel free to reach out to discuss my previous or current work.</p> </body></html>
